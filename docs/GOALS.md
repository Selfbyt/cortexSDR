# CortexSDR: Project Goals

- Compress any neural network model (including LLMs up to 70B+ parameters) to run on low-end devices
- Enable robust, lossy inference without requiring the full computation graph
- Support per-layer, selective, and brain-like inference for flexible AI applications
- Make AI accessible, efficient, and affordable for everyone
