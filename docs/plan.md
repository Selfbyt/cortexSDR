# PLAN: Scaling CortexSDR for 70B+ Parameter Models on Low-End CPUs

## 1. Model Compression & Storage
- **Universal SDR/Quantization:**
  - Ensure all model weights (embeddings, attention, MLP, layer norms, etc.) are compressed using SDR, quantization, or hybrid strategies. No layer should be stored dense.
- **Chunked/Streaming Storage:**
  - Store model weights in chunks (e.g., per-layer, per-head, per-matrix block) to allow partial loading and avoid memory spikes.
- **On-Disk/Memory Mapping:**
  - Use memory-mapped files or on-demand disk streaming to avoid loading the entire model into RAM.

## 2. Efficient Inference Engine
- **Blockwise/Windowed Computation:**
  - Implement blockwise matrix multiplication and attention, processing only the required window of tokens/weights at a time.
- **Sparse Kernel Optimization:**
  - Write or integrate highly optimized sparse matrix kernels (possibly using libraries like Intel MKL, OpenBLAS, or custom SIMD code).
- **Quantized Inference:**
  - Support 8-bit and 4-bit quantized inference, with dequantization only for the active blocks/rows.

## 3. Memory & Resource Management
- **Layer-by-Layer Execution:**
  - Process one (or a few) layers at a time, releasing memory for previous layers as soon as possible.
- **Activation Checkpointing:**
  - Store only necessary activations, recomputing others as needed to save RAM.
- **Swap/Cache Management:**
  - Implement a smart cache for recently used weights/activations, with LRU eviction.

## 4. Model Partitioning & Parallelism
- **Model Sharding:**
  - Allow splitting the model across multiple files/disks, and load only the required shards for the current computation.
- **Multi-Process/Threaded Inference:**
  - Use multi-threading or multi-processing to parallelize independent parts of the computation (e.g., attention heads, layers).

## 5. I/O and Preprocessing
- **Fast Tokenization/Detokenization:**
  - Optimize the tokenizer to handle large batches and minimize string processing overhead.
- **Asynchronous I/O:**
  - Overlap disk reads with computation to hide I/O latency.

## 6. User Experience & CLI
- **Progress Reporting:**
  - Show progress bars and memory usage during inference.
- **Configurable Resource Limits:**
  - Allow users to set RAM/CPU usage limits and batch sizes.

## 7. Testing & Validation
- **Unit/Integration Tests:**
  - Add tests for chunked loading, quantized inference, and large-model edge cases.
- **Benchmarking:**
  - Benchmark on low-end CPUs (e.g., Raspberry Pi, old laptops) and optimize bottlenecks.

## 8. Documentation & Community
- **Update Documentation:**
  - Document all new features, configuration options, and best practices for running large models.
- **Community Feedback:**
  - Gather feedback from users running large models and iterate on pain points.

### Next Steps
1. Update the codebase to support chunked and streaming weight loading.
2. Implement blockwise sparse/quantized matrix multiplication.
3. Refactor inference loop for layer-by-layer and windowed execution.
4. Test with a large (multi-billion parameter) model in streaming mode.
5. Profile and optimize for memory and CPU usage.
